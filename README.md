# GDCelestial

Celestial physics implementation for Godot 4.

## Currently supported

- [x] 2D conic sections.
- [ ] 3D conic sections.
- [ ] 2D N-body.
- [ ] 3D N-body.

Most of the math is done in generic base-classes, so 3D should be easy to implement.
I hope...

Stay tuned!

## Known problems

The current implementation of a Kepler equation solver is far from optimal.
